### 1. Modify the Predefined Torque Law
Replced the sinusoidal disturbance with a random impulse disturbance.Generated random disturbances at specified intervals in time

### 2. Experiment with Different Gearbox Ratios
N=5, N=20, N=50

### 3. Adjust PID Gains
Adujsted PID constants to (try to :) ) achieve minimal overshoot, fast settling time, and minimal steady-state error.

Kp = 20
Ki = 5
Kd = 2
